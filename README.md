# 🌐 Full-Stack STP – Web Projects by Simran

Hi! I'm **Simran**, and this repository marks the beginning of my journey into full-stack web development.  
I’ve completed a **Summer Training Program in Full-Stack Development from IIT Kanpur**, and this repository contains both my **mini-project** and **final project** as part of the course.

## 🎉 SimTrip – My First Ever Website!

[🔗 Visit SimTrip](https://sim-run06.github.io/Full-Stack-STP/)  
**SimTrip** is a fully responsive static tourism website created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 3.  
It showcases destinations, packages, services, a photo gallery, and more — all built from scratch as part of the **front-end mini-project**.

This was my **first-ever deployed website**, and I’m super proud of it! 💖  
It was a big milestone for me — designing everything, structuring the pages, and deploying it using GitHub Pages.

## 🌸 Florify – My Final Full-Stack Project!

[🔗 Visit Florify](https://florifyfinalproject.infinityfree.me/)  
**Florify** is a simple **online flower store web application** built using PHP, MySQL (MariaDB), HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 3.  
It allows users to browse flowers, add them to a cart, and place orders. An admin panel is included for managing products, users, and orders.

This project helped me understand **database integration, backend logic, and dynamic web development** for the first time! 🚀
