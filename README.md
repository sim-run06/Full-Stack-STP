# 🌐 Full-Stack STP – Web Projects by Simran

Hi! I'm **Simran**, and this repository marks the beginning of my journey into full-stack web development.  
I’m currently doing a **Summer Training Program in Full-Stack Development from IIT Kanpur**, and this repository is where I’ll be uploading both my **mini-project** and **final project** as part of the course.

## 🎉 SimTrip – My First Ever Website!

[🔗 Visit SimTrip](https://sim-run06.github.io/Full-Stack-STP/)  
**SimTrip** is a fully responsive static tourism website created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 3. It showcases destinations, packages, services, a photo gallery, and more — all built from scratch as part of the front-end mini-project.

This is my **first-ever deployed website**, and I’m so happy and proud of it! 💖  
It was a big milestone for me — designing everything, structuring the pages, and deploying using GitHub Pages.

## 🚧 Final Project (Coming Soon...)

The **final project** will include full-stack functionality — with both front-end and back-end integration.  
Once that’s complete, I will create a small **landing page** inside this repo that introduces me and links both projects (SimTrip + Final Project) in one place.

## 📌 Repo Purpose

This repo is a central place for:

- ✨ My mini front-end project (`SimTrip`)
- 🛠️ My upcoming full-stack final project
- 🌱 Documenting my learning journey in web development

> I’m just getting started, but super excited about what’s ahead. Thanks for checking out my work!
